This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to null value handling in functions. The `foo` function exhibits unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments. The initial implementation simply exits without explicit handling for nulls. The solution offers a robust approach that checks for nulls and gracefully handles them, preventing unexpected behavior.
